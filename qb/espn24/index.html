	<div>I was a writer and editor for <a href="https://collegiate.quizbowlpackets.com/3110/">2024 ESPN (Ethan Strombeck's Pre-Nationals)</a>, an open-level set. As a writer, I wrote 70 total questions, or slightly more than 10% of the set. As an editor, I was in charge of the American History, Current Events, and Other Academic questions.
	
	<br>This was my first experience writing and editing for a higher-difficulty set. Continuing with the vision I had for my previous work, I wanted to have both questions that stuck to a particular theme as well as questions that drew from multiple sources of knowledge. 
		Examples of the former include the tossup on the <b><u>Washington</b></u> family's slaves and the tossup on <b><u>George H. W. Bush</b></u> centered around quotes, and the latter include tossups on <b><u>Disneyland</b></u> and  <b><u>data</b></u>.

	<br>I also completed a personal goal of writing at least one question for each subcategory, which is an excellent exercise in putting together information from different categories and learning from the questions writing process!

	<br>Finally, I was lucky to be able to staff two in-person sites at Columbia and Brown, where I saw the questions befuddle, challenge, and delight players. The recordings from my room at the Columbia site <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1xemSX8bIPUFfNeIZd6hoxXgTFE5H5kG7">can be found here</a>. 		Many thanks to all of my co-writers and editors, as well as anyone who played and enjoyed the questions!
