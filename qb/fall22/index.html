	<div>I was an editor for <a href="https://collegiate.quizbowlpackets.com/2827/">2022 ACF Fall</a>, a tournament designed for novice college players. 
	
	<br>Specifically, I was in charge of the American History, Geography, and Math/Computer Science. I also moderated at the Harvard mirror, where I witnessed some of my questions being the final finals deciders.
