	<div>I was an editor for <a href="https://collegiate.quizbowlpackets.com/2827/">2022 ACF Fall</a>, a tournament designed for novice college players. 
	
	<br>Specifically, I was in charge of the American History, Geography, and Math/Computer Science. I also moderated at the Harvard mirror, where I witnessed some of my questions being the final finals deciders.
	
	<br>My vision for the math and computer science was to include topics encountered in standard high school/intro college classes (so no highly abstract/complex topics).
	<br>For geography and US history, I wanted to have diversity between geographic regions, the type of history (political/social/military), as well as highlighting underrepresented groups as themes of questions or as clues in questions not focused on them. Also for geography, 
	I wanted to include both physical/touristy and human/cultural geography, with a focus on how people interact with the world and care about it.

	<br>In all the categories, I wanted to include real-world importance "fresh" answerlines that were still convertible or asking about a simple idea from another perspective.
