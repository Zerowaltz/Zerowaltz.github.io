	<div>I was the tournament director for the 2023 SCT mirror at Brown on February 4, which featured <a href="https://hsquizbowl.org/db/tournaments/7270/">10 teams</a>. 
	
	<br>This tournament notably occurred during the February 3-4 New England Arctic cold, which saw a wind chill down to -40 degrees. I was prepared, since <a href="../regs22/index.html">I had had experience with winter weather threatening a nationals-qualifying tournament before</a>.
	
	<br>On the day of the tournament, trains from Boston were delayed for more than two hours due to cold-related malfunctions. This left half of the DI field and some DII teams stranded.  After back and forth emails and phone calls with NAQT about the situation, we decided to make up the games during lunch and read at a faster-than-normal pace. 
	
	<br>Despite the delays, we still miraculously finished on time, due to a combination of my tournament director skills, expert staffers, and good teams and questions.
	
	<br>Because this was an NAQT tournament, recordings were not made of the matches.
