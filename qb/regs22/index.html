	<div>I was the tournament director for the 2022 ACF Regionals mirror at Brown on January 29, which featured <a href="https://hsquizbowl.org/db/tournaments/7270/">10 teams</a>. 
	
	This tournament was initially scheduled to occur in-person; preparations were made months in advance, including room reservations, trophies, and book prizes. In the weeks before the tournament, more than half of the 12 initial teams dropped due to COVID-related reasons. 
	
	<br> Then, in the week before the tournament, a blizzard threatened to, and then actually did, force the tournament to move online. We regained most of the teams and staffers that would not have come in-person, for an overall smooth tournament.
	
	<br>Recordings of the finals can be found here:
