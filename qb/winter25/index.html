	<div>I was an editor for <a href="https://collegiate.quizbowlpackets.com/3404/">2025 ACF Winter</a>, a medium-difficulty set for players of all skill levels. As a writer, I wrote 44 total questions, one of which was outside of my categries (the Key West poetry bonus). As an editor, I was in charge of the American History, Social Science, Geography, and Other Academic questions.

	<br>I did not initially apply to edit Social Science. The editor dropped out a little into set production due to personal reasons, and when the head editor asked if I wanted to take over, I accepted. This would almost double my workload from 1.5/1.5 to 2.5/2.5 questions per packet. I had never edited the category at any level before, and there were some moments where I doubted my own ability to create the questions, but I was able to realize much of the previous editor's list of ideas and create a product that (most) people enjoyed.
	<br>Finally, I was able to staff the Northeast site at Harvard, where read the top playoff/superplayoff rounds. I attempted to speedrun reading the finals and did so in 23 minutes. The recordings from my room at the Harvard site are forthcoming. Many thanks to all of my co-editors and playtesters, and to future players who will hopefully learn something from the questions!
