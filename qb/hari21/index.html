	<div>I was a writer and editor for HARI (Hari's Academic Regs- Invitational), a 2021-2022 set at two dots difficulty. 
		
		<br>I wrote 30% of the set, spanning every category and almost every subcategory, and was an editor for Math/CS and Geography/Current Events/Other Academic.
	
	<br>I was also a tournament director for the mirror at Brown on November 20, which featured <a href="https://hsquizbowl.org/db/tournaments/7159/">8 teams</a>.
