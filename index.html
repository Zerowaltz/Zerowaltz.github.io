	<p class="lead">Hi, I'm <span itemprop="name">Walter Zhang</span>, a student at Brown University.</p>
	<p>I am currently pursuing a joint Sc.B. in Computer Science and Applied Math and concurrently a M.S. in Computer Science. I have also taken courses in History, Urban Studies, Classics, Religious Studies, Economics, Neuroscience, Cognitive Sciences, English, and Politics.</p>
		
	<p> I had been an undergraduate teaching assistant in the CS department for 3 semesters and a Head TA in that department for 1 semester.

        <p> In my spare time, I learn random facts and manifest them through quizbowl. I also play violin, video games, vaguely non-video games, and on words. I like exploring places and collecting maps.</p>
