	<h2>10-27-2021: 5/10</h2>
	Today was a gloomy day in which the rain dampened any moods that would have occurred. However, I did figure out a direction I want to take this page: I will rank each day, on a scale of 1 to 10 (with 10 being the best). I did this retroactively for the past few days. Somewhat counterintuitively, an "average" day should correspond to a 7.5, but negative events tend to outweigh positive ones in my mind, so this will be an experiment for the long run. I will also make tier lists of other things I enjoy, like music from my playlist.

	<h2>10-26-2021: 5/10</h2>
	I had a dream in which someone took my debit card. Then they withdrew the money in $180 increments at multiple ATMs - probably to avoid suspicion. I woke up as I was trying to give a tip to the campus detectives (this part is the closest in mirroring the situation in real life). So now I will never leave anything valuable unattended in public again.

	<h2>10-25-2021: 0/10</h2>
	Absolutely terrible day. My e-scooter was stolen. The lock was cut in broad daylight. I don't expect much in the way of getting it back.


	<h2>10-24-2021: 7.5/10</h2>
	Since I am writing these at 1 am, each post technically corresponds to the day before.
	
	<br>
	
	On Saturdays without quizbowl, I always attend Go club meetings. I can tell the same story I tell everyone there - I learned to play weiqi when I was little and lived in China, did not play it for many years, but am now experiencing a "renaissance." 
	At a cosmopolitan community such as Brown, I expected clubs of people that shared niche interests of mine, including weiqi. But I did not expect the combination of characters, some familiar and others new, both in their similarities to (many of us have study CS/math) and differences from (some were international students from China; others American) me. 
	I want to catch up on how the game has changed in the last decade or so, especially with the advent of AI. I even watch Nick Sibicky now like I would chess channels. 
	
	<br>Will there always be a moral to the day's story? Probably not.
	
	<h2>10-23-2021: 8.5/10</h2>
	
	This is the first post, in which I guess I will establish the rules for all future posts. My goal is to document one thing about each day - whether one memorable event, thing, or even a thought.
	I haven't thought about all the technical details yet, but the words are the most important part. I hope that this becomes a daily thing - kind of like a semi-public diary.<sup class="onhover">*
