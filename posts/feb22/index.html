		<h2>3-5-2022</h2>
Yes, this is several days late. I subconsciously realized it was March when I knew to began writing my dates with a "3", but I didn't realize that meant the beginning of a new month until I was walking back to my dorm, noticing that it was warmer.
	<br> This month, I read/finished reading:

<ul>
 
  <li>All My Sons by Arthur Miller</li>
  <li>Copenhagen by Michael Frayn</li>
  <li>Dubliners by James Joyce</li>
</ul>

It was a short month, but I didn't realize I finished so little works (maybe this isn't the best metric, compared to "books began" or even "pages read"). School is really beginning to catch up, and I also put some time into making crossword videos and writing questions instead. I have acquired digitally several books, and physically bought several more. Hopefully I can resume reading, if I can put my mind to it.
