		<h2>10-4-2022</h2>
	<br> This month, I read/finished reading:

<ul>
 
  <li>Elizabeth Finch by Julian Barnes</li>
  <li>The Faraway Nearby by Rebecca Solnit</li>
  <li>Places of the Heart by Colin Ellard</li>
    <li>Sad Topographies by Damien Rudd</li>


</ul>

<br>We're coming up on a full year of tracking my reads! As per last month, the reads led me to more nonfiction books about places. I started some of them back in the summer, but it was not until the plane ride and lunches in the cafeteria
when I found time for them. Sadly, I do not think I can keep up the pace since I will have more things to worry about.

<br>I lied; this is the month I go to buy more books from the Harvard Bookstore, including the highly anticipated sequel by Randall Munroe.</div>
