	And just like that, we are at the end of a new month. With school picking back up, I expect that I will have less time to read and to do anything else really. I did drop my fifth class so I won't be working all the time. Self-care!
	<br> This month, I read/finished reading:

<ul>
  <li>Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? by Philip Dick<sup class="onhover">*
	<span class="tooltiptext">For class</span>
	</sup></li>
  <li>The Glass Menagerie by Tennessee Williams</li>
  <li>Journey to the East by Hermann Hesse</li>
  <li>Invention of Love by Tom Stoppard</li>
  <li>McDonaldization of Society by George Ritzer</li>
  <li>History of the World in 10 1/2 Chapters by Julian Barnes</li>
</ul>

I will not be rating these books, as this is not GoodReads and I don't like having opinions on things. These books are already self-selecting in that I would not read them if I did not like them, though.
