		<h2>9-1-2022</h2>
	<br> This month, I read/finished reading:

<ul>
 
  <li>99% Invisible City by Roman Mars and Kurt Kohlstedt</li>
  <li>Interior Chinatown by Charles Yu</li>

</ul>

<br>
I finished a nonfiction book about places (and the fictional one too, if you think about it) and started a couple more nonfiction books about places. In fact, I was on the verge of repeating only reading one book until I found and read Interior Chinatown in about one and a half hours on the last day of the month.

<br> Next month, I will hopefully finish more books as well as read the highly anticipated sequel by Randall Munroe.</div>
