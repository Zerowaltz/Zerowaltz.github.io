		<h2>11-24-2021</h2>
	The campus store was closing at 3 because of Thanksgiving, so I set out for the main green before the sun had any hint of setting. 
	
	<br>I wanted milk. With this and the other food I had I could hibernate in my room for the remainder of the break. I had already left my dorm once today going to and coming back from lunch. To mix things up, I deliberately took side routes. One of these paths took me up Thayer street, where I turned left into Soldiers' Arch.
	
	<br>The field was empty, save for two peopleto the left locked in embrace. I didn't get a good look at their faces, but it was statistically unlikely that I knew either of them. I tried to silence my footsteps as they left my sight, for this was their tender moment. I continued the rest of the way.
	
	<br>In the normally full student center, only one of the seats was filled. I grabbed a couple cartons of milk, shook them to make sure that they were not expired, and decided against getting any other snacks.
	
	<br>I was gearing up for the subzero weather, donning my gloves and hat, when I heard a small rustling sound in a leaf pile on the ground. I bent down; there was no wind, so whatever caused it must have been in the leaf pile itself. I dug around until I saw it. A beady eye belonging to some mousy creature saw me back. I wanted to get a closer look at its body and maybe get photographic documentation, so I tried to shift the leaf pile to uncover it, but it moved in return so that only its tail stuck out. I moved on, letting it shelter from the warmth among the leaves once more.
	
	<br>I retraced my steps back to the Soldiers' Arch. To my surprise, the embracing couple was still there. They were still unwilling to let each other go. This time there were multiple people, including me approaching their position; sensing that their private bubble could not hold any longer, they split up, one heading into the dorm and the other up the road. I did not know their stories; all I knew was that they did not want to part with one another, even for possibly only a few days.
	
	<br>It was then that I decided to sit down and write down this story.
	
	
	<h2>11-21-2021</h2>
	My latest fixation is reading. The new regular posts will be of books I have read. I am at a pace of nearly one book every day - of course, that will change depending on the length of the book I choose to dive into and the amount of time and focus I can put towards finishing it.
	
	<br> This week, I read/finished reading:

<ul>
  <li>jPod by Douglas Coupland</li>
  <li>The Natural by Bernard Malamud</li>
  <li>Leaving the Atocha Station by Ben Lerner</li>
  <li>The Reluctant Fundamentalist by Mohsin Hamid</li>
  <li>A Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time by Mark Haddon</li>
</ul>

I do not have anything in particular to say about any of the books, except that I enjoyed reading them; if they were not good, I would not have chosen to read them. They all share a sense of realism (even jPod), some relatability for me.
