	<h2>11-9-2021: 7.5/10</h2>
	Hectic day of interviews, with some people not showing up and others having to swap around to different times. Even my own internship interview was rescheduled. I have an advising meeting tomorrow (during one of my classes) and I have no idea what to talk about with my advisor, who I have never met. I also need to take the time to prep for in-person TA hours. I would like to know what to say in those situations before I get to them; hopefully I can improv something if I don't figure it out.

	<h2>11-8-2021: 8/10</h2>
	I trekked to Andrews to my breakfast (even though this was 1:30) wrapped in a burrito, rather than the bowl I usually get. Everything was going smoothly, until when everything fell apart and I had to resort to getting a knife and fork that I remembered why I do not get the burrito.
	
	<br>I also set up a new section of the site, including recordings of the finals of the tournament yesterday - and almost ran over my daily bandwidth allowance on Firebase immediately. Hopefully it doesn't get that much traffic.

	<h2>11-6-7-2021: 8/10</h2>
	Oh boy it finally happened. I was so tired that I missed an entire day. Here's a quick rundown:
	
	<ul>
  <li>Coffee</li>
  <li>Milk</li>
  <li>Tea</li>
  <li>got hit in the face with a baseball</li>
  <li>Pho</li>
  <li>practiced on ACF Winter before the tournament</li>
  <li>ran out of energy to do yesterday's post</li>
  <li>ran back and forth between rooms a lot</li>
  <li>ç²¥</li>
  <li>ran a successful ACF Winter</li>
  <li>felt a sense of pride and accomplishment</li>
  <li>chilled with friends on a Saturday night</li>
</ul>



	<h2>11-5-2021: 8.5/10</h2>
	Today I spoke multiple times in discussion section, gave good interviews, and had a good interview even though the first person didn't even show up. (Yes!) However, I messed up a lot and struggled to give adequate responses in TA hours. So overall I would have to say the good outweighed the bad. 
	
	<br>Interactions with people are hard.


	<h2>11-4-2021: 7/10</h2>
	More interviews, free time into. The one bad thing that happened today was me stepping in a muddy hole during a fire drill that almost interrupted an interview and resulted in me having to borrow some shoes. I am still trying to balance the line between being busy and having many things to do and looking back on tonight and realizing that I spent most of it doing nothing.

	<h2>11-3-2021: 7.5/10</h2>
	Interviewed our first candidate; we definitely took too long and didn't have the ranking system ready. It's a learning experience for all of us, the interviewers included. Can't say which one I was more nervous for, that or going to a professor's office hours. Not that either was nervewracking - which is where the difficulty in comparing them comes in.

	<h2>11-2-2021: 8/10</h2>
	Well, so much for that streak, as I am writing this at 1:21. I realized today that besides the interviews, I have relatively few other things this week. A nice contrast from the midterms abound in the previous weeks. The weather is weird in that I have to wear heavy jackets/pants to get to classes, but I would burn up if I wore them inside. This brings back old memories of the dilemma of having to pick what I wear the entire day based on the 5 minute walk to school. We had a solid showing at practice today, including an outside guest. We are getting ready to host a tournament, our first since February 2020, this weekend.
	
	<br>Note to self: the Blue Room is a shell of what was once greatness. Do not go there for breakfast again.
