		<h2>11-24-2021</h2>
	The campus store was closing at 3 because of Thanksgiving, so I set out for the main green before the sun had any hint of setting. 
	
	<br>I wanted milk. With this and the other food I had I could hibernate in my room for the remainder of the break. I had already left my dorm once today going to and coming back from lunch. To mix things up, I deliberately took side routes. One of these paths took me up Thayer street, where I turned left into Soldiers' Arch.
	
	<br>The field was empty, save for two peopleto the left locked in embrace. I didn't get a good look at their faces, but it was statistically unlikely that I knew either of them. I tried to silence my footsteps as they left my sight, for this was their tender moment. I continued the rest of the way.
	
	<br>In the normally full student center, only one of the seats was filled. I grabbed a couple cartons of milk, shook them to make sure that they were not expired, and decided against getting any other snacks.
	
	<br>I was gearing up for the subzero weather, donning my gloves and hat, when I heard a small rustling sound in a leaf pile on the ground. I bent down; there was no wind, so whatever caused it must have been in the leaf pile itself. I dug around until I saw it. A beady eye belonging to some mousy creature saw me back. I wanted to get a closer look at its body and maybe get photographic documentation, so I tried to shift the leaf pile to uncover it, but it moved in return so that only its tail stuck out. I moved on, letting it shelter from the warmth among the leaves once more.
	
	<br>I retraced my steps back to the Soldiers' Arch. To my surprise, the embracing couple was still there. They were still unwilling to let each other go. This time there were multiple people, including me approaching their position; sensing that their private bubble could not hold any longer, they split up, one heading into the dorm and the other up the road. I did not know their stories; all I knew was that they did not want to part with one another, even for possibly only a few days.
	
	<br>It was then that I decided to sit down and write down this story.
	
	
	<h2>11-21-2021</h2>
	As you can see by the gap in the past week, I have abandoned my previous posting model. Mostly because the days weren't that interesting, some were too hard and sad to post about, and I internally review each day anyways. My latest fixation is reading. In fact, my propensity for reading started at the same time as my urge for doing daily ratings stopped, but that was probably a coincidence.
	
	<br> So the new regular posts will be of books I have read. I am at a pace of nearly one book every day - of course, that will change depending on the length of the book I choose to dive into and the amount of time and focus I can put towards finishing it.
	
	<br> This week, I read/finished reading:

<ul>
  <li>jPod by Douglas Coupland</li>
  <li>The Natural by Bernard Malamud</li>
  <li>Leaving the Atocha Station by Ben Lerner</li>
  <li>The Reluctant Fundamentalist by Mohsin Hamid</li>
  <li>A Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time by Mark Haddon</li>
</ul>

I do not have anything in particular to say about any of the books, except that I enjoyed reading them; if they were not good, I would not have chosen to read them. They all share a sense of realism (even jPod), some relatability for me.

	<h2>11-15-2021: 5/10</h2>
	I woke up at a normal time but did not leave my room until 2. Felt bad and ate little all day. I am ready for more of a break.
	
	<h2>11-13-14-2021: 7.5/10</h2>
Friday: It rained all day. Under those conditions, I took a midterm, and interviewed more people (the last ones). It was the least I have studied for a midterm. We will have to see how it turns out.
	
	<br> Saturday: It rained some more. We went to Harvard, where I had the same lunch as at my last in-person tournament in February 2020, and got second in a tournament. 
	But we finally have a win against Yale and MIT. Hopefully this will only strenghten our resolve. It was nice to finally play with the team again and to see people from before, including at the train station.
	
	<br>The whole experience reminded me of the things I missed about the world: the continuities of lives that are always running alongside ours. Experiences accumulate and people go in and out of view.
	
	<br>So the days average out to an average day.
	
<h2>11-12-2021: 6/10</h2>
I skipped going to morning class for the first time today because I was feeling a little bad. I think lunch and dinner were the two fullest meals I've had in a while - I've never felt so sated. Despite my best efforts, I spoke up in discussion section today when literally no one else seemed to want to say anything. Helped out a student in TA hours. Not bad overall - except for the general feeling of sadness and physical pain.

<h2>11-13-2021: 2.5/10</h2>
A day is not good when you cry yourself to sleep. I think I am managing otherwise, but it still hurts having something valuable taken away from you. 

<h2>11-10-2021: 7.5/10</h2>
	Ate lunch with a full table of friends. Met with my advisor to decide what to take next semester (Narrator: he has not decided.) Had a phone interview that I had to skip class for - the first time I've missed a class all semester. Helped out someone in hours today. But the highlight of the day has to be in my morning, where I just kept getting emails. One after another. At one point I got 3 in the same minute. Maybe everyone just decided that around 11 on a Tuesday is perfect time to get that inbox done. Some emails were good news; others not so good. 
	I always try to reply lightning-fast - after all, I have nothing better to do than to sit in front of my computer and respond everything that comes my way.

	<h2>11-9-2021: 7.5/10</h2>
	Hectic day of interviews, with some people not showing up and others having to swap around to different times. Even my own internship interview was rescheduled. I have an advising meeting tomorrow (during one of my classes) and I have no idea what to talk about with my advisor, who I have never met. I also need to take the time to prep for in-person TA hours. I would like to know what to say in those situations before I get to them; hopefully I can improv something if I don't figure it out.

	<h2>11-8-2021: 8/10</h2>
	I trekked to Andrews to my breakfast (even though this was 1:30) wrapped in a burrito, rather than the bowl I usually get. Everything was going smoothly, until when everything fell apart and I had to resort to getting a knife and fork that I remembered why I do not get the burrito.
	
	<br>I also set up a new section of the site, including recordings of the finals of the tournament yesterday - and almost ran over my daily bandwidth allowance on Firebase immediately. Hopefully it doesn't get that much traffic.

	<h2>11-6-7-2021: 8/10</h2>
	Oh boy it finally happened. I was so tired that I missed an entire day. Here's a quick rundown:
	
	<ul>
  <li>Coffee</li>
  <li>Milk</li>
  <li>Tea</li>
  <li>got hit in the face with a baseball</li>
  <li>Pho</li>
  <li>practiced on ACF Winter before the tournament</li>
  <li>ran out of energy to do yesterday's post</li>
  <li>ran back and forth between rooms a lot</li>
  <li>ç²¥</li>
  <li>ran a successful ACF Winter</li>
  <li>felt a sense of pride and accomplishment</li>
  <li>chilled with friends on a Saturday night</li>
</ul>



	<h2>11-5-2021: 8.5/10</h2>
	Today I spoke multiple times in discussion section, gave good interviews, and had a good interview even though the first person didn't even show up. (Yes!) However, I messed up a lot and struggled to give adequate responses in TA hours. So overall I would have to say the good outweighed the bad. 
	
	<br>Interactions with people are hard.


	<h2>11-4-2021: 7/10</h2>
	More interviews, free time into. The one bad thing that happened today was me stepping in a muddy hole during a fire drill that almost interrupted an interview and resulted in me having to borrow some shoes. I am still trying to balance the line between being busy and having many things to do and looking back on tonight and realizing that I spent most of it doing nothing.

	<h2>11-3-2021: 7.5/10</h2>
	Interviewed our first candidate; we definitely took too long and didn't have the ranking system ready. It's a learning experience for all of us, the interviewers included. Can't say which one I was more nervous for, that or going to a professor's office hours. Not that either was nervewracking - which is where the difficulty in comparing them comes in.

	<h2>11-2-2021: 8/10</h2>
	Well, so much for that streak, as I am writing this at 1:21. I realized today that besides the interviews, I have relatively few other things this week. A nice contrast from the midterms abound in the previous weeks. The weather is weird in that I have to wear heavy jackets/pants to get to classes, but I would burn up if I wore them inside. This brings back old memories of the dilemma of having to pick what I wear the entire day based on the 5 minute walk to school. We had a solid showing at practice today, including an outside guest. We are getting ready to host a tournament, our first since February 2020, this weekend.
	
	<br>Note to self: the Blue Room is a shell of what was once greatness. Do not go there for breakfast again.
