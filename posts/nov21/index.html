	<h2>11-3-2021: 7.5/10</h2>
	Interviewed our first candidate; we definitely took too long and didn't have the ranking system ready. It's a learning experience for all of us, the interviewers included. Can't say which one I was more nervous for, that or going to a professor's office hours. Not that either was nervewracking - which is where the difficulty in comparing them comes in.

	<h2>11-2-2021: 8/10</h2>
	Well, so much for that streak, as I am writing this at 1:21. I realized today that besides the interviews, I have relatively few other things this week. A nice contrast from the midterms abound in the previous weeks. The weather is weird in that I have to wear heavy jackets/pants to get to classes, but I would burn up if I wore them inside. This brings back old memories of the dilemma of having to pick what I wear the entire day based on the 5 minute walk to school. We had a solid showing at practice today, including an outside guest. We are getting ready to host a tournament, our first since February 2020, this weekend.
