	<h2>11-15-2021: 5/10</h2>
	I woke up at a normal time but did not leave my room until 2. Felt bad and ate little all day. I am ready for more of a break.
	
	<h2>11-13-14-2021: 7.5/10</h2>
Friday: It rained all day. Under those conditions, I took a midterm, and interviewed more people (the last ones). It was the least I have studied for a midterm. We will have to see how it turns out.
	
	<br> Saturday: It rained some more. We went to Harvard, where I had the same lunch as at my last in-person tournament in February 2020, and got second in a tournament. 
	But we finally have a win against Yale and MIT. Hopefully this will only strenghten our resolve. It was nice to finally play with the team again and to see people from before, including at the train station.
	
	<br>The whole experience reminded me of the things I missed about the world: the continuities of lives that are always running alongside ours. Experiences accumulate and people go in and out of view.
	
	<br>So the days average out to an average day.
	
<h2>11-12-2021: 6/10</h2>
I skipped going to morning class for the first time today because I was feeling a little bad. I think lunch and dinner were the two fullest meals I've had in a while - I've never felt so sated. Despite my best efforts, I spoke up in discussion section today when literally no one else seemed to want to say anything. Helped out a student in TA hours. Not bad overall - except for the general feeling of sadness and physical pain.

<h2>11-13-2021: 2.5/10</h2>
A day is not good when you cry yourself to sleep. I think I am managing otherwise, but it still hurts having something valuable taken away from you. 

<h2>11-10-2021: 7.5/10</h2>
	Ate lunch with a full table of friends. Met with my advisor to decide what to take next semester (Narrator: he has not decided.) Had a phone interview that I had to skip class for - the first time I've missed a class all semester. Helped out someone in hours today. But the highlight of the day has to be in my morning, where I just kept getting emails. One after another. At one point I got 3 in the same minute. Maybe everyone just decided that around 11 on a Tuesday is perfect time to get that inbox done. Some emails were good news; others not so good. 
	I always try to reply lightning-fast - after all, I have nothing better to do than to sit in front of my computer and respond everything that comes my way.

	<h2>11-9-2021: 7.5/10</h2>
	Hectic day of interviews, with some people not showing up and others having to swap around to different times. Even my own internship interview was rescheduled. I have an advising meeting tomorrow (during one of my classes) and I have no idea what to talk about with my advisor, who I have never met. I also need to take the time to prep for in-person TA hours. I would like to know what to say in those situations before I get to them; hopefully I can improv something if I don't figure it out.

	<h2>11-8-2021: 8/10</h2>
	I trekked to Andrews to my breakfast (even though this was 1:30) wrapped in a burrito, rather than the bowl I usually get. Everything was going smoothly, until when everything fell apart and I had to resort to getting a knife and fork that I remembered why I do not get the burrito.
	
	<br>I also set up a new section of the site, including recordings of the finals of the tournament yesterday - and almost ran over my daily bandwidth allowance on Firebase immediately. Hopefully it doesn't get that much traffic.

	<h2>11-6-7-2021: 8/10</h2>
	Oh boy it finally happened. I was so tired that I missed an entire day. Here's a quick rundown:
	
	<ul>
  <li>Coffee</li>
  <li>Milk</li>
  <li>Tea</li>
  <li>got hit in the face with a baseball</li>
  <li>Pho</li>
  <li>practiced on ACF Winter before the tournament</li>
  <li>ran out of energy to do yesterday's post</li>
  <li>ran back and forth between rooms a lot</li>
  <li>ç²¥</li>
  <li>ran a successful ACF Winter</li>
  <li>felt a sense of pride and accomplishment</li>
  <li>chilled with friends on a Saturday night</li>
</ul>



	<h2>11-5-2021: 8.5/10</h2>
	Today I spoke multiple times in discussion section, gave good interviews, and had a good interview even though the first person didn't even show up. (Yes!) However, I messed up a lot and struggled to give adequate responses in TA hours. So overall I would have to say the good outweighed the bad. 
	
	<br>Interactions with people are hard.


	<h2>11-4-2021: 7/10</h2>
	More interviews, free time into. The one bad thing that happened today was me stepping in a muddy hole during a fire drill that almost interrupted an interview and resulted in me having to borrow some shoes. I am still trying to balance the line between being busy and having many things to do and looking back on tonight and realizing that I spent most of it doing nothing.

	<h2>11-3-2021: 7.5/10</h2>
	Interviewed our first candidate; we definitely took too long and didn't have the ranking system ready. It's a learning experience for all of us, the interviewers included. Can't say which one I was more nervous for, that or going to a professor's office hours. Not that either was nervewracking - which is where the difficulty in comparing them comes in.

	<h2>11-2-2021: 8/10</h2>
	Well, so much for that streak, as I am writing this at 1:21. I realized today that besides the interviews, I have relatively few other things this week. A nice contrast from the midterms abound in the previous weeks. The weather is weird in that I have to wear heavy jackets/pants to get to classes, but I would burn up if I wore them inside. This brings back old memories of the dilemma of having to pick what I wear the entire day based on the 5 minute walk to school. We had a solid showing at practice today, including an outside guest. We are getting ready to host a tournament, our first since February 2020, this weekend.
	
	<br>Note to self: the Blue Room is a shell of what was once greatness. Do not go there for breakfast again.
	<h2>11-1-2021: 7.5/10</h2>
	Not a super interesting day. I was so tired from yesterday that did nothing all morning, had the fullest breakfast/lunch ever (If only there was a word that combined the two.), and did like two assignments all afternoon/night. For the next two weeks or so I will be busy with interviews, both to hire next semester's TAs and for next summer's internship. I will have a 2 day streak of sleeping before 1 am; let's see how long that lasts.
	
	<br>Eventually I will have this section separated by month, but technically this belongs with October's posts.

	<h2>10-31-2021: 8/10</h2>
	Quizbowl was good. I didn't do as well placement-wise as I hoped I would or as I did two years ago playing by myself as a freshman, but I'm glad to have a good team and teammates. I took my first (and second) Amtrak. I also had lunch with a friend from high school in the same place that I saw him last more than 2 years ago. I was so tired that I slept before 11, even through any parties that would have occurred during Halloweek (so if anyone was wondering where it was - it's here now.).

	<h2>10-30-2021: 7.5/10</h2>
	While everyone else dressed up for Halloween (it's not even Halloween yet?) and partied, I usual Friday night traidition of goingto the practice room. I remain hopeful yet wary about the future. Starting with this tournament tomorrow. Which I went to sleep at the regular time for, meaning that I would sleep for about 4 hours.

	<h2>10-29-2021: 6/10</h2>
	Below average day where several things could have gone better: I didn't speak up in history discussion section today; there was no milk at Jo's; and the two 80 minute classes felt like slogs. I could never bring myself to just not go to class, even if it means that I could "save time" by watching the recordings later at a faster speed. Even in freshman year I had near-perfect attendance, but now I feel like I missed out on so much in-person instruction in the past year. Going to class every day at a set time gives my days a sense of structure, lest they fall down a slippery slope into disorder. 
	
	<br>I am not excited about looking at the single digit Celsius temperature forecasts on my computer screen.

	<h2>10-28-2021: 8/10</h2>
	The weather has not improved. I found some small victories: I figured out how to load YouTube music to Spotify on my phone. I worked on the top floor of the Scili next to a window from which I can look out into the harbor. But today is the first day since I started this that I am truly looking forward instead of looking back: I am a day or so ahead in my assignments, which in itself is not unfulfilling; we have our first real quiz bowl tournament this weekend; and we are even beginning to plan for the course next semester for which I am a co-head TA.
	The enduring optimism is a large factor in raising the rating. Let's hope nothing snuffs it out.

	<h2>10-27-2021: 5/10</h2>
	Today was a gloomy day in which the rain dampened any moods that would have occurred. However, I did figure out a direction I want to take this page: I will rank each day, on a scale of 1 to 10 (with 10 being the best). I did this retroactively for the past few days. Somewhat counterintuitively, an "average" day should correspond to a 7.5, but negative events tend to outweigh positive ones in my mind, so this will be an experiment for the long run. I will also make tier lists of other things I enjoy, like music from my playlist.

	<h2>10-26-2021: 5/10</h2>
	I had a dream in which someone took my debit card. Then they withdrew the money in $180 increments at multiple ATMs - probably to avoid suspicion. I woke up as I was trying to give a tip to the campus detectives (this part is the closest in mirroring the situation in real life). So now I will never leave anything valuable unattended in public again.
 
	<h2>10-25-2021: 0/10</h2>
	Absolutely terrible day. My e-scooter was stolen. The lock was cut in broad daylight. I don't expect much in the way of getting it back.


	<h2>10-24-2021: 7.5/10</h2>
	Since I am writing these at 1 am, each post technically corresponds to the day before.
	
	<br>
	
	On Saturdays without quizbowl, I always attend Go club meetings. I can tell the same story I tell everyone there - I learned to play weiqi when I was little and lived in China, did not play it for many years, but am now experiencing a "renaissance." 
	At a cosmopolitan community such as Brown, I expected clubs of people that shared niche interests of mine, including weiqi. But I did not expect the combination of characters, some familiar and others new, both in their similarities to (many of us have study CS/math) and differences from (some were international students from China; others American) me. 
	I want to catch up on how the game has changed in the last decade or so, especially with the advent of AI. I even watch Nick Sibicky now like I would chess channels. 
	
	<br>Will there always be a moral to the day's story? Probably not.
	
	<h2>10-23-2021: 8.5/10</h2>
	
	This is the first post, in which I guess I will establish the rules for all future posts. My goal is to document one thing about each day - whether one memorable event, thing, or even a thought.
	I haven't thought about all the technical details yet, but the words are the most important part. I hope that this becomes a daily thing - kind of like a semi-public diary.<sup class="onhover">*
	<span class="tooltiptext">It should be said that some words should be left unsaid.</span>
