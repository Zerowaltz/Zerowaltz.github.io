	<h2>11-1-2021: 7.5/10</h2>
	Not a super interesting day. I was so tired from yesterday that did nothing all morning, had the fullest breakfast/lunch ever (If only there was a word that combined the two.), and did like two assignments all afternoon/night. For the next two weeks or so I will be busy with interviews, both to hire next semester's TAs and for next summer's internship. I will have a 2 day streak of sleeping before 1 am; let's see how long that lasts.
	
	<br>Eventually I will have this section separated by month, but technically this belongs with October's posts.

	<h2>10-31-2021: 8/10</h2>
	Quizbowl was good. I didn't do as well placement-wise as I hoped I would or as I did two years ago playing by myself as a freshman, but I'm glad to have a good team and teammates. I took my first (and second) Amtrak. I also had lunch with a friend from high school in the same place that I saw him last more than 2 years ago. I was so tired that I slept before 11, even through any parties that would have occurred during Halloweek (so if anyone was wondering where it was - it's here now.).

	<h2>10-30-2021: 7.5/10</h2>
	While everyone else dressed up for Halloween (it's not even Halloween yet?) and partied, I usual Friday night traidition of goingto the practice room. I remain hopeful yet wary about the future. Starting with this tournament tomorrow. Which I went to sleep at the regular time for, meaning that I would sleep for about 4 hours.

	<h2>10-29-2021: 6/10</h2>
	Below average day where several things could have gone better: I didn't speak up in history discussion section today; there was no milk at Jo's; and the two 80 minute classes felt like slogs. I could never bring myself to just not go to class, even if it means that I could "save time" by watching the recordings later at a faster speed. Even in freshman year I had near-perfect attendance, but now I feel like I missed out on so much in-person instruction in the past year. Going to class every day at a set time gives my days a sense of structure, lest they fall down a slippery slope into disorder. 
	
	<br>I am not excited about looking at the single digit Celsius temperature forecasts on my computer screen.

	<h2>10-28-2021: 8/10</h2>
	The weather has not improved. I found some small victories: I figured out how to load YouTube music to Spotify on my phone. I worked on the top floor of the Scili next to a window from which I can look out into the harbor. But today is the first day since I started this that I am truly looking forward instead of looking back: I am a day or so ahead in my assignments, which in itself is not unfulfilling; we have our first real quiz bowl tournament this weekend; and we are even beginning to plan for the course next semester for which I am a co-head TA.
	The enduring optimism is a large factor in raising the rating. Let's hope nothing snuffs it out.

	<h2>10-27-2021: 5/10</h2>
	Today was a gloomy day in which the rain dampened any moods that would have occurred. However, I did figure out a direction I want to take this page: I will rank each day, on a scale of 1 to 10 (with 10 being the best). I did this retroactively for the past few days. Somewhat counterintuitively, an "average" day should correspond to a 7.5, but negative events tend to outweigh positive ones in my mind, so this will be an experiment for the long run. I will also make tier lists of other things I enjoy, like music from my playlist.

	<h2>10-26-2021: 5/10</h2>
	I had a dream in which someone took my debit card. Then they withdrew the money in $180 increments at multiple ATMs - probably to avoid suspicion. I woke up as I was trying to give a tip to the campus detectives (this part is the closest in mirroring the situation in real life). So now I will never leave anything valuable unattended in public again.
 
	<h2>10-25-2021: 0/10</h2>
	Absolutely terrible day. My e-scooter was stolen. The lock was cut in broad daylight. I don't expect much in the way of getting it back.


	<h2>10-24-2021: 7.5/10</h2>
	Since I am writing these at 1 am, each post technically corresponds to the day before.
	
	<br>
	
	On Saturdays without quizbowl, I always attend Go club meetings. I can tell the same story I tell everyone there - I learned to play weiqi when I was little and lived in China, did not play it for many years, but am now experiencing a "renaissance." 
	At a cosmopolitan community such as Brown, I expected clubs of people that shared niche interests of mine, including weiqi. But I did not expect the combination of characters, some familiar and others new, both in their similarities to (many of us have study CS/math) and differences from (some were international students from China; others American) me. 
	I want to catch up on how the game has changed in the last decade or so, especially with the advent of AI. I even watch Nick Sibicky now like I would chess channels. 
	
	<br>Will there always be a moral to the day's story? Probably not.
	
	<h2>10-23-2021: 8.5/10</h2>
	
	This is the first post, in which I guess I will establish the rules for all future posts. My goal is to document one thing about each day - whether one memorable event, thing, or even a thought.
	I haven't thought about all the technical details yet, but the words are the most important part. I hope that this becomes a daily thing - kind of like a semi-public diary.<sup class="onhover">*
