		<h2>5-4-2022</h2>
	<br> This month, I read/finished reading:

<ul>
 
  <li>Three Men in a Boat by Jerome K. Jerome</li>
  <li>Fathers and Sons by Ivan Turgenev</li>
</ul>

A new low record; even Fathers and Sons shouldn't really count because I finished it on May 1st, and I realized that I could have easily finished it in a spare chunk of time in the prior week.

<br> I thought I would have plenty of time to read on the 4 plane rides, but I realized that I'd rather sleep and look out the dynamism outside the window rather than staring at the same static screen. Also, I tried to reconcile reading for quiz bowl with reading for fun after our nationals were over, so I really need to pick books that interest me.

<br> I know that I will read at least one book next month: on May 24, the first physical book whose release I've looked forward to.
