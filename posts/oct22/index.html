		<h2>11-2-2022</h2>
	<br> This month, I read/finished reading:

<ul>
  <li>Several People Are Typing by Calvin Kasulke</li>
   <li>Travels with George by Nathaniel Philbrick</li>
  <li>What if? 2 by Randall Munroe</li>
  <li>What if? by Randall Munroe</li>


</ul>

<br>As promised, a good reading month now that I found how to structure my time and remembered to read. There were bursts and marathons in reading these books, and I welcomed the mix of fiction and nonfiction. 

<br>I was able to buy What If? 2 at the Harvard Bookstore with my membership discount. Then after I read it, I realized I didn't actually read the first one (I did read everything on the website and his other books, though), so I went back and read that as well in the same day.</div>
