		<h2>4-3-2022</h2>
	<br> This month, I read/finished reading:

<ul>
 
  <li>Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs by Chuck Klosterman</li>
  <li>Eating the Dinosaur by Chuck Klosterman</li>
  <li>Flaubert's Parrot by Julian Barnes</li>
</ul>

Another busy month, capped off by "active traveling" (i.e. driving) during spring break means that once again, reading was put to the backseat. Though my book-buying spree did continue. 

<br>

I did enjoy reading the short-form nonfiction as a change of pace. Scrolling down the pages felt the same as listening to someone telling you about something about their life or experiences. Even Flaubert's Parrot falls into this category, where the main character is giving information in a variety of ways, and sometimes I forget that the storylines are fictional (well, the ones about Flaubert are not). It is in this vein that I am trying to find my next books to read.
