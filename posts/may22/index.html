		<h2>6-3-2022</h2>
	<br> This month, I read/finished reading:

<ul>
 
  <li>Cannery Row by John Steinbeck</li>
  <li>Either/Or by Elif Batuman</li>
</ul>

Some cognitive dissonance as I believed to have read a good amount, but turns out to only have read 2 books, like in April. I did finish a book per plane/car journey, so at least I know that given absolutely nothing else to do, I will be able to read.

<br>

Either/Or was the book I was looking forward to reading. I was assigned <i>The Idiot</i> as reading for just before my first year as she went through her formative experience. The fact that I could relate to so many of the experiences she outlined made the book so special to me. This sequel does come a couple years late, as I am waiting for her to catch up to where I am now. 

<br>I don't think I found this book as profound as the first. The plot, if you can call it one, is not focused and is not the main focus of the book. Instead, we get to see people drift in and out of her academic and social life, her having experiences that diverge from mine. I guess that's the point - no one can give you a blueprint or checklist on how to life. I am not at Harvard in 1996. But the idyll of the campus is the same.

<br>I will (hopefully) read more books this month.
